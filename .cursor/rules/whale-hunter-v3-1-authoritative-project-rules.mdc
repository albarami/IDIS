# Overview
PROJECT: Whale Hunter v3.1 (Dark Forest)

AUTHORITATIVE DOCS
docs/POLICY.md, GATES.md, DATA_DICTIONARY.md, API_REFERENCE.md,
IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md, THREAT_MODEL.md, RUNBOOK.md, EVENTS.pdf
are binding for this project.

BUILD ORDER (MANDATORY)
1. Database & schema (DATA_DICTIONARY)
2. Gates & veto engine (POLICY order)
3. API clients (pinned endpoints only)
4. Phase 0 tools (logger, harvester, backtest)
5. Simulator (shadow only)
6. Metrics & Go/No-Go checks
7. Assassin ONLY after GATES approval

PHASE AWARENESS
Current phase must be respected.
Do not implement Phase N+1 features early.
Assassin code must remain disabled until simulator ≥95% accuracy.

FAIL-CLOSED DESIGN
All gates default to BLOCK.
Missing data, stale data, or API failure must veto execution.

GRAPH RULES
Graph signals BOOST confidence only until Phase 3.
Trust decays (30-day half-life). Trust earned slowly, lost quickly.
CEX-funded wallets are low-quality signals.

EVENT LOGGING
All major decisions must emit structured events per EVENTS spec.

OUTPUT DISCIPLINE
For coding tasks, follow the two-role workflow:
Engineer (implement) + Verifier (break & approve).
